- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @tinaxluo
- ğŸ‘¥ I used to be a Technical Recruiter before transitioning into data
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all things data analysis
- ğŸª¡ Creating visuals, dashboards, and stories is very engaging to me!
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, dBt, SQL, and data warehousing 
- âš¡ Fun fact: Though I enjoy good food, I am certainly an eat-to-live type of person! I love dogs , tea, weight training, and quiet sunny mornings!
